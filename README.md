# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
## by default
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# by history cmd run
```
npm i create-react-app
npx create-react-app app
npx hardhat@2.9.2
npx hardhat compile
--> split terminal in 3 part  <-- (1)npm strat react,  (2)npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost  (3) npx hardhat node
```
